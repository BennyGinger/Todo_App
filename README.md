## About <a name = "about"></a>

Simple todo app to keep track of your tasks. This was built as a learning project to get familiar with GUI,
and in particular, FreeSimpleGUI library. Along side, I also built a simplier version for webapp using streamlit library.

In the 'Side_apps' folder, I've also included simple GUI projects that I used to learn the library. One app that compresses files, one that convert feet to meters, and one that takes images from own library or using the built-in webcam, and convert them to grayscales.

## Getting Started <a name = "getting_started"></a>

All these projects are mostly using standard python libraries, except for the GUI libraries. To store the todos,
a todos.txt file will be created in the same directory as the app.


### Installing

If you want to run the todo_app, you need to install the FreeSimpleGUI library. 

```bash
pip install FreeSimpleGUI
```


If you want to run the webapp version of the todo_app, you need to install the streamlit library. 

```bash
pip install streamlit
```

The other apps in the 'Side_apps' folder are using standard libraries, but will also require either the FreeSimpleGUI or the streamlit libraries.
